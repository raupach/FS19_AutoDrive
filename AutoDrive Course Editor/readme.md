# Start AutoDrive Course Editor
The editor can be started with the supplied CMD file: "Open Editor with Console to see errors.cmd". The editor can also be started from the command line: java -jar AD.jar

The editor will create the log file autoDriveEditor.log, which is used for later troubleshooting. This file has a maximum size of 20MB. A maximum of 3 version files are then created.
To save the configuration, the editor will also create the adEditor.conf file.

At the first start the LS19 game directory is queried. In most cases, the directory is: c:\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2019. This entry is only necessary at the first start:

Switch to the Network Manager tab.
